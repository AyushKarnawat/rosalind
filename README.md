## Introduction
Bioinformatics is a emerging field that utilizes the power of programming to understand biological data. 

These are my solutions to a collection of problems found on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/). Rosalind is a platform that allows you to learn bioinformatics from a fundamental level, allowing you to reseach theory and then apply that knowledge to solve computational problems in bioinformatics using data structures and algorithms. 

## Motivation
Let's get to the point: I am really interested in bioinformatics and programming, but I suck at programming and am even worse at bioinformatics. This is a way for me to learn bioinformatics and become better at programming.  

## Navigating the Repo
The files are meant to be standalone scripts, to be used with the in-built Python 3.5.2 library. 

The `dataset` folder in each directory contains a sample dataset that I downloaded from the ROSALIND website for each problem. Note: The data changes everytime you attempt to solve the problem so make sure to change the content of the respective file and save before calling the function in your favorte terminal using `python {filename}.py` where `{filename}` is the name of the file you want to run.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.5.2: You didn't think we would do this in Python 2.7, did you?
* Your ability to think

## Other Notes
You should really attempt the problems yourself before looking at the code. This is just meant to be a helping hand just in-case you get stuck.
